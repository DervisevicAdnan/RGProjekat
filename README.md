# AR Application – Château de Sully-sur-Loire

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) application developed as part of a Computer Graphics course. The application brings history to life by allowing users to visualize a 3D model of Château de Sully-sur-Loire in AR, offering an immersive and interactive way to explore this historic French castle.

The goal of this project is to blend technology and history, making cultural heritage more engaging through augmented reality. By pointing a mobile device at a marker, users can see a detailed 3D model of the castle, interact with it, and access educational content about the castle and the region.



## Features and Development Process
*  The **3D model** of the castle was carefully crafted in **Blender**, maintaining historical accuracy while creating a visually appealing representation.

*  **Unity** was used as the main development platform, offering essential tools for rendering and interactive features.

*  **Vuforia**, a powerful AR framework, was used to implement **marker-based AR**, allowing users to scan an image (marker) to trigger the appearance of the castle in augmented reality.

*  The application was designed to run on **Android devices**.

This project is strictly for **educational purposes** and does **not** involve any commercial use.
